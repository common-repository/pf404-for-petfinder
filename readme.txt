== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q. How does it get animals available for adoption?
A. The plugin calls the PetFinder API once a day and collects a list of 18 random animals across the US (of the type you specified in the plugin settings), and stores these in the database.
Q. Is there a way to only show animals from a certain area? 
A. Not at this time but this is an enhancement I hope to add in the future.
